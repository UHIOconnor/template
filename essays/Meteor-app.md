Meteor to me has been a mixed bag. Trying to learn it over the past couple of weeks has been a trying expriance. compared to picking up
base html or semantic UI meteor has been a lot more involved. part of the diffuculty i suppose is based on meteor being a culmination of 
the other tools i ahve picked up. However it hasnt been all hard, for example the local application that meteor hosts makes it much simpler
to debug code.
