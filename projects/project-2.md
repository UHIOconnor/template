One of my first projects in ICS this Rock Paper Scissors project stuck with me as it taught me
the some of my first intricacies of coding. In this specific case i was expecting a simple
game using the basic coding i had learned but i actually learned a lot about how computers
deal with random numbers. Learning about seeding random numbers and the pseudo randomness
of the result from a simple concept like rock paper scissors has stuck with me as a
testament how any coding assigment can teach you something new.
