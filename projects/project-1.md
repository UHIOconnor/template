Cram is an application designed to allow UH students the ability to easily create, join, or manage study sessions.

Cram was created as a project for ICS 314 and the team consisted of four members. The application utilizes Javascript,
HTML, Semantic UI, and Meteor. Working on this project was an interesting experiance for me because i had never done
this kind of group work. Working with my group through Github was probaly my largest learning experiance during
this project.
